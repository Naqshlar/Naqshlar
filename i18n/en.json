  "introduction": "For centuries, the people of present-day Uzbekistan have decorated their homes, clothing, and everyday items with ornamentsâ€”each holding special meaning or serving a specific purpose. \nFabrics are adorned using various techniques: embroidery, block printing (imprint on the fabric), and weaving colored threads into the material's base. Ornaments vary by regional styles and intended use. For example, some pattern elements are employed in clothing and headwear, while others are used for tablecloths and suzani (home decorative textile).\nMost of the embroidery and block printing patterns are inspired by nature. For example, many designs feature the sun and stars, animals, flowers, and fruits.\nThis website will introduce you to the most common patterns found on suzani, clothing, and carpets. Here, you will find detailed descriptions of each ornament, its color scheme, and the meaning that the creators put into it.\nThe 3D models for printing, available for download on this website, will help you understand the shape of the ornaments and form a complete impression.\n"
